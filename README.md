# Front-garden

## Install project and start to dev :
- clone repo 
- `yarn` 
- `yarn dev` and go to http://127.0.0.1:5173/ to see your changes
- don't forget to create a branch for each feature and make pull-request, never push directly to master :) 

### See storybook doc : 
- `yarn storybook`
- got to localhost:6006

### Run linting :
- `yarn lint` (or `yarn lint:fix` to fix autofixable warnings/errors)
- ESlint and Prettier extensions exist in most mainstream IDEs 🛂. You could format on save and/or display warning/error squiggly lines 〰️ without running the script.
